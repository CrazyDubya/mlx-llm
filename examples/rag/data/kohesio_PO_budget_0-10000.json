Black Carbon (BC) is a component of aerosol particles produced during incomplete combustion and is associated with both air pollution and climate change. The impacts of black carbon on the environment and human health are diverse and cross-cutting. Black carbon-containing particles have a porous structure and a large",

This creates a risk for humans to poison with adsorbed toxic substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals on the surface of particles. Aerosol particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 1 \u03bcm are particularly dangerous to human health because they are small enough to enter the lungs through the airways and through the alveols to the circulatory system by transporting adsorbed toxic substances, thereby causing various diseases or",

The continuous exposure of humans to aerosol particles is considered to be one of the main causes of increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, there are no norms for black carbon concentrations and emissions in the European Union, and the potential effects on human health are not known and controlled.

Candida albicans, the most commonly identified species of biofilm, poses a serious threat to public health due to increasing resistance to antifungal drugs, which are currently insufficient to provide quality treatment (fungus regenerating after a certain period of time). Several mechanisms may justify such resistance. One of these is the action of an intercellular polymeric",

The consequence of this type of remedy is a number of strategies that could disrupt the colonisation and formation of C. albicans biofilms, such as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). APDT consists of non-toxic dyes, photosensitiser FS and low intensity visual light, which combines and releases cytotoxic substances in the presence of oxygen. However, due to the complexity of CVT, FS is unable to reach the",

The method of measuring the stable isotope ratio is based on the ability of chemical elements to have two or more stable isotopes.

In practice, cars with different fuels will be studied, simulating car driving modes in urban, rural areas.",

Due to their distinctive nature, polyester polyurethanes can be degraded by enzymes secreted by microorganisms, and the resulting compounds are metabolised. Meanwhile, polyeterial PU is much more intertwined not only for atmospheric effects, but also for biological degradation. For these reasons, polyether PU has more user-friendly characteristics but complicates the management and recycling of PU waste. Biodegradation could",

Macrophages are one of the most numerous groups of immune cells that inflation tumours. Cancer cells have been shown to be able to attract circulating monocytes into the tumour, convert them into macrophages and polarise them into a subtype of M1 (tumor) or M2 (tumor inducing).

This information is necessary to identify the underlying trends and causes of the spread of diseases. Zoonoses in cats are viral, bacterial, nematode, primary and arthropodic infections. Disease agents are naturally transmitted, directly or indirectly, to humans. Cats play a key role in the transmission of Mycoplasma pathogens, being their reservoir hosts. The detection of these pathogens is complex, in some cases found in healthy cats, and most often",

Moreover, at the end of this millennium it is expected to reach the 900 ppm threshold. Therefore, ways to reduce atmospheric CO2 are already being explored. The use of enzymes to reduce CO2 emissions, for example by adapting an enzyme that captures CO2 in the atmosphere and converts it into human useful products such as acrylates, polycarbonates or methane, could be a solution. One of these is the new, little studied biocatalyst, carboanhydrase (KA). The enzyme naturally catalyses",

In addition, climate change resulting from the burning of fossil fuels leads to public interest in alternative energy sources to replace petroleum products and coal. Photovoltaic systems that convert solar energy into electricity could fully meet current energy needs. At present, silicon solar cells are widely used in practice, but",

One of the most promising alternatives is Perovskitic Solar Cells (PSE). The recent energy conversion performance has increased from 4\u00a0% to over 22\u00a0% over the last 8 years, and these elements are also characterised by simplicity of design and low cost. A few years ago,",

In addition, devices of this kind have been shown to be more stable. Currently, as n-type semiconductors, compounds containing a sulerene C60 fragment are widely used, but the molecules of this type of material are large and therefore have poor contact with the perovskite surface, which leads to insufficient good conductivity of chargers. One way to ensure good electron",

This type of compound could form a corroding relationship with the perovskite surface by ensuring good contact between the surfaces, which would improve the transfer speed of the chargers.",
